__Two learning manners__

* Bottom-up

    stimulus-driven, mostly obtained from early features, task independent
    
* Top-down

    related to recognition processing, influenced by prior knowledge (e.g.
    tasks to be performed, feature distribution of target, context of visual
    scene, etc.)

Saliency

* __Saliency Detection__

Evaluation

* ROC

    $$

* AOC: area under curve
    * shuffled AUC (sAUC) [Zhang et al.]: eliminating _edge effect_
